 Understanding REST API Status Codes – More Than Just 200 OK 🌐

When building RESTful APIs, HTTP status codes are your API’s first line of communication with clients. Handling them correctly improves debugging, user experience, and system resilience.

Here’s a quick refresher:

✅ 2xx – Success

200 OK: Standard success.

201 Created: Resource created (e.g., after POST).

204 No Content: Successful, no response body.

⚠️ 4xx – Client Errors

400 Bad Request: Malformed syntax or invalid input.

401 Unauthorized: Auth required or failed.

403 Forbidden: Auth okay, but no access.

404 Not Found: Resource doesn’t exist.

429 Too Many Requests: Rate limiting in action.

💥 5xx – Server Errors

500 Internal Server Error: Something broke.

502 Bad Gateway: Downstream service failed.

503 Service Unavailable: Temporarily offline (maintenance, overload).

504 Gateway Timeout: Upstream didn’t respond in time.

🎯 Best Practices:

Use the most specific status code.

Avoid always returning 200 with error info in the body (hard to monitor).

Log 5xx errors. Alert on spikes.
