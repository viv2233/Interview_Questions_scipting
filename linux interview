System Logs s Troubleshooting Scenarios
===========================
1. Your server is rebooting randomly. How do you investigate the cause?

We check logs using journalctl -xe and dmesg for kernel or hardware issues.
We also inspect /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog for any panic or crash messages.
Hardware failures, cron reboots, or misconfigured watchdogs may be responsible.

2. A user reports that they are getting a "Permission Denied" error when accessing a log file. What could be the issue?

We check the file's permissions and ownership using ls -l.
If the user lacks read access or the directory has restricted access (dr-x or ---), it causes issues.
We adjust permissions using chmod or grant access via group membership.

3. An application is crashing frequently. How do you collect logs and debug it?

We inspect the application's logs, often located in /var/log/ or under the app’s folder.
Using journalctl -u <service> helps if it’s a systemd service.
We can also run the application manually with debugging flags or use strace.

4. How do you configure logging to rotate logs automatically?

We configure /etc/logrotate.conf or use custom files in /etc/logrotate.d/.
Logrotate manages file rotation, compression, and deletion based on size or time.
We test settings using logrotate -d and apply them with logrotate -f.

5. Your system logs are filling up disk space. How do you manage them?

We check log sizes using du -sh /var/log/* and clean up old logs.
We can compress them manually or rely on logrotate to auto-manage them.
Clearing journal logs using journalctl --vacuum-size=100M also helps.

6. How do you check which user deleted a specific file?

By default, Linux doesn’t track deletions, so we need auditd for this.
We configure audit rules like auditctl -w /path/to/file -p wa to monitor deletions.
Then check the logs using ausearch -f <filename> or aureport.

7. How do you troubleshoot a slow boot process in Linux?

We run systemd-analyze and systemd-analyze blame to see startup time breakdowns.
It helps identify services that delay the boot.
We can disable or mask unnecessary services using systemctl.

8. How do you check if a service crashed and restarted automatically?

We use journalctl -u <service> or systemctl status <service> to check logs and restart count.
Repeated crashes may show messages like "Main PID exited" or "core dumped".
For persistent logs, ensure journald is properly configured.

9. How do you enable persistent logging on a Linux system?

By default, journald logs may be stored in memory.
We make logging persistent by creating /var/log/journal and restarting systemd-journald.
This keeps logs even after a reboot.

10. A cron job is not running as expected. How do you debug it?

We check the cron logs using grep CRON /var/log/syslog or journalctl -u cron.
Permissions, wrong paths, or missing environment variables often cause failures.
Redirecting output and errors to a log file in the cron entry also helps.

Linux Q/A 41 To 50
-----------------------
41. What are the different types of process states in Linux?

Linux processes can be in states like Running (R), Sleeping (S), Stopped (T), Zombie (Z), and Waiting (D).
You can check these using ps -eo pid,stat,cmd.
Understanding these states helps us manage and troubleshoot process-related issues.

42. How do you check environment variables in Linux?

We use the printenv, env, or echo $VARIABLE commands to view environment variables.
For example, echo $HOME shows the current user's home directory.
These variables are essential for configuring the shell and user environment.

43. How do you permanently set an environment variable?

To set a variable permanently, we add it to configuration files like ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile.
Example: add export PATH=$PATH:/opt/myapp/bin to ~/.bashrc.
Then run source ~/.bashrc to apply changes immediately.

44. What is the purpose of the /etc/fstab file?

The /etc/fstab file defines how and where disk partitions, devices, or network shares are mounted.
It is read during boot to mount filesystems automatically.
Each line includes device name, mount point, filesystem type, and mount options.

45. How do you mount and unmount a filesystem?

We use the mount command to mount: mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data.
To unmount, we use umount /mnt/data.
Ensure no processes are using the mount point before unmounting to avoid errors.

46. What is LVM (Logical Volume Manager) in Linux?

LVM allows us to create flexible and resizable disk storage using physical volumes (PVs), volume groups (VGs), and logical volumes (LVs).
We can resize, move, or snapshot volumes without downtime.
It is ideal for dynamic storage management on servers.

47. How do you check free memory and swap space?

We use free -h to see human-readable output of RAM and swap usage.
top and vmstat also provide real-time memory statistics.
This helps us monitor system performance and detect memory issues.

48. How do you clear swap space?

To clear swap, we turn it off and on using: sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a.
This forces the system to move swapped data back to RAM.
It’s useful for freeing up swap space during performance tuning.

49. What is the difference between hard links and symbolic links?

Hard links point to the same inode as the original file, sharing the actual data.
Symbolic links are like shortcuts that reference a file path.
If the original file is deleted, a hard link remains valid, but a symlink breaks.

50. What is the difference between sed and awk?

sed is a stream editor used for text substitution, like replacing strings in files.
awk is more powerful, useful for pattern scanning and data extraction by columns.
We use sed for quick edits and awk for advanced data processing.
===================
System’s Kernel Scenarios
=================
1. How do you upgrade the Linux kernel safely?

We first check the current kernel version using uname -r.
Then we use package managers like apt, dnf, or yum to upgrade the kernel, e.g., sudo apt install linux-generic.
Always reboot and keep the old kernel as a fallback option in the GRUB menu.

2. You need to enable a specific kernel module. How do you do it?

We use modprobe <module_name> to load the module temporarily.
To load it at every boot, we add it to /etc/modules or create a .conf file under /etc/modules-load.d/.
We can verify it's loaded using lsmod.

3. A server crashes with a kernel panic. How do you troubleshoot and fix it?

Check /var/log/kern.log or journalctl -k for error messages before the panic.
Hardware issues, bad drivers, or corrupted initramfs can trigger panics.
Boot into a previous kernel or recovery mode to troubleshoot and update/reinstall drivers or kernel.

4. How do you find out which kernel version is running on your system?

Use the command uname -r to see the running kernel version.
You can also check cat /proc/version for detailed info.
hostnamectl also displays kernel version info in modern distros.

5. You need to disable a specific kernel module permanently. How do you do it?

Create a blacklist file under /etc/modprobe.d/, e.g., blacklist.conf, and add blacklist <module_name>.
To prevent loading via initramfs, rebuild it using update-initramfs -u (Debian-based).
Reboot to apply changes and confirm with lsmod.

6. Your server has high load but low CPU and memory usage. What could be causing it?

High load may be due to blocked I/O, such as slow disks or NFS hangs.
Run top, iotop, or vmstat to diagnose waiting processes.
Check disk latency with iostat or dstat.

7. How do you check if the system supports virtualization?

Run egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo.
A non-zero value means virtualization is supported by the CPU.
You can also use lscpu or virt-host-validate to verify virtualization support.

8. A package update broke a system service. How do you roll back the update?

Use the package manager’s history, like yum history undo <id> or apt install <package>=<old-version>.
You can check logs in /var/log/dpkg.log or /var/log/yum.log.
After rollback, restart the affected service with systemctl.

9. How do you force a system to reboot after a kernel panic?

Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add kernel.panic = 10 to reboot after 10 seconds.
Apply it with sysctl -p.
This ensures the system automatically reboots instead of hanging on panic.

10. How do you apply security patches to a running Linux system without rebooting?

Use live patching tools like Canonical Livepatch, ksplice, or kpatch.
These tools apply kernel updates to memory without restarting.
This is ideal for critical systems requiring high uptime.
==============================
******AWS Troubleshooting****** 

1. You shared an AMI with another AWS account, but they can’t launch an instance from it.
 A: Most forget to share the EBS snapshot linked to the AMI. Without it, the AMI shows up but fails at launch.

2. ALB marks your targets as unhealthy, but the app works in your browser.
 A: ALB health checks are picky. A 301 redirect or login page will cause failure. It wants a clean 200 OK response.

3. ECS still runs the old container version after pushing a new image to ECR.
 A: If you’re using tags like latest, ECS might pull from cache. Use unique tags or digests to ensure it fetches the correct version.

4. In EKS, your stateful pod with an EBS volume is stuck in Pending. Why?
 A: EBS volumes are AZ-bound. If the pod lands in a node from another AZ, it can’t attach the volume. Ensure the node group spans the correct Availability Zone.

5. Your EKS pod can’t access S3, even though IAM roles for service accounts are enabled.
 A: The pod must use a service account annotated with the IAM role. If it’s using the default service account or missing the annotation, the IAM role won’t apply.

6. EC2 has a public IP and security group allows traffic—but it’s unreachable. Why?
 A: *No Internet Gateway attached to the VPC.
*Route table doesn't point to the Internet Gateway.
*NACLs are blocking traffic.
*OS firewall (like iptables) is blocking.
*Service not running or listening on the wrong port.

7. You restored a production RDS snapshot in staging, but queries behave differently.
