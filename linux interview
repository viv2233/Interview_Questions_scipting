System Logs s Troubleshooting Scenarios
===========================
1. Your server is rebooting randomly. How do you investigate the cause?

We check logs using journalctl -xe and dmesg for kernel or hardware issues.
We also inspect /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog for any panic or crash messages.
Hardware failures, cron reboots, or misconfigured watchdogs may be responsible.

2. A user reports that they are getting a "Permission Denied" error when accessing a log file. What could be the issue?

We check the file's permissions and ownership using ls -l.
If the user lacks read access or the directory has restricted access (dr-x or ---), it causes issues.
We adjust permissions using chmod or grant access via group membership.

3. An application is crashing frequently. How do you collect logs and debug it?

We inspect the application's logs, often located in /var/log/ or under the app’s folder.
Using journalctl -u <service> helps if it’s a systemd service.
We can also run the application manually with debugging flags or use strace.

4. How do you configure logging to rotate logs automatically?

We configure /etc/logrotate.conf or use custom files in /etc/logrotate.d/.
Logrotate manages file rotation, compression, and deletion based on size or time.
We test settings using logrotate -d and apply them with logrotate -f.

5. Your system logs are filling up disk space. How do you manage them?

We check log sizes using du -sh /var/log/* and clean up old logs.
We can compress them manually or rely on logrotate to auto-manage them.
Clearing journal logs using journalctl --vacuum-size=100M also helps.

6. How do you check which user deleted a specific file?

By default, Linux doesn’t track deletions, so we need auditd for this.
We configure audit rules like auditctl -w /path/to/file -p wa to monitor deletions.
Then check the logs using ausearch -f <filename> or aureport.

7. How do you troubleshoot a slow boot process in Linux?

We run systemd-analyze and systemd-analyze blame to see startup time breakdowns.
It helps identify services that delay the boot.
We can disable or mask unnecessary services using systemctl.

8. How do you check if a service crashed and restarted automatically?

We use journalctl -u <service> or systemctl status <service> to check logs and restart count.
Repeated crashes may show messages like "Main PID exited" or "core dumped".
For persistent logs, ensure journald is properly configured.

9. How do you enable persistent logging on a Linux system?

By default, journald logs may be stored in memory.
We make logging persistent by creating /var/log/journal and restarting systemd-journald.
This keeps logs even after a reboot.

10. A cron job is not running as expected. How do you debug it?

We check the cron logs using grep CRON /var/log/syslog or journalctl -u cron.
Permissions, wrong paths, or missing environment variables often cause failures.
Redirecting output and errors to a log file in the cron entry also helps.

Linux Q/A 41 To 50
-----------------------
41. What are the different types of process states in Linux?

Linux processes can be in states like Running (R), Sleeping (S), Stopped (T), Zombie (Z), and Waiting (D).
You can check these using ps -eo pid,stat,cmd.
Understanding these states helps us manage and troubleshoot process-related issues.

42. How do you check environment variables in Linux?

We use the printenv, env, or echo $VARIABLE commands to view environment variables.
For example, echo $HOME shows the current user's home directory.
These variables are essential for configuring the shell and user environment.

43. How do you permanently set an environment variable?

To set a variable permanently, we add it to configuration files like ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile.
Example: add export PATH=$PATH:/opt/myapp/bin to ~/.bashrc.
Then run source ~/.bashrc to apply changes immediately.

44. What is the purpose of the /etc/fstab file?

The /etc/fstab file defines how and where disk partitions, devices, or network shares are mounted.
It is read during boot to mount filesystems automatically.
Each line includes device name, mount point, filesystem type, and mount options.

45. How do you mount and unmount a filesystem?

We use the mount command to mount: mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data.
To unmount, we use umount /mnt/data.
Ensure no processes are using the mount point before unmounting to avoid errors.

46. What is LVM (Logical Volume Manager) in Linux?

LVM allows us to create flexible and resizable disk storage using physical volumes (PVs), volume groups (VGs), and logical volumes (LVs).
We can resize, move, or snapshot volumes without downtime.
It is ideal for dynamic storage management on servers.

47. How do you check free memory and swap space?

We use free -h to see human-readable output of RAM and swap usage.
top and vmstat also provide real-time memory statistics.
This helps us monitor system performance and detect memory issues.

48. How do you clear swap space?

To clear swap, we turn it off and on using: sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a.
This forces the system to move swapped data back to RAM.
It’s useful for freeing up swap space during performance tuning.

49. What is the difference between hard links and symbolic links?

Hard links point to the same inode as the original file, sharing the actual data.
Symbolic links are like shortcuts that reference a file path.
If the original file is deleted, a hard link remains valid, but a symlink breaks.

50. What is the difference between sed and awk?

sed is a stream editor used for text substitution, like replacing strings in files.
awk is more powerful, useful for pattern scanning and data extraction by columns.
We use sed for quick edits and awk for advanced data processing.
