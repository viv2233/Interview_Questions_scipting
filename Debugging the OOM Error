 Debugging the OOM Error
Check System Logs

Look for oom-killer messages in logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
dmesg | grep -i 'killed process'
journalctl -k | grep -i oom
This shows which process was killed, why, and how much memory it was using.

Analyze /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages

These logs might show detailed memory usage leading to the OOM event:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo less /var/log/syslog
sudo less /var/log/messages
Check Resource Usage Over Time

Use tools like:

top, htop, or glances (interactive)

vmstat or free -m (snapshots)

sar (for historical performance data)

Use smem or ps_mem.py for accurate per-process memory usage:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo smem -r | sort -k 4 -nr | head
Look for Memory Leaks

If your application is consuming more memory over time, it may have a leak.

Use tools like:

valgrind (C/C++)

memory_profiler (Python)

JVM tools (jmap, jconsole, VisualVM) for Java

Review Memory Limits (Containers/Cloud)

For Docker or Kubernetes, check if the container has memory limits:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker inspect <container_id> | grep Memory
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
üõ°Ô∏è Preventing OOM Conditions
Increase System Memory

Add more RAM if possible.

Set Resource Limits

Use ulimit (Linux shell):

bash
Copy
Edit
ulimit -v <max_virtual_memory_kb>
In Kubernetes:

yaml
Copy
Edit
resources:
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
Tune the OOM Killer Behavior

Adjust oom_score_adj or oom_adj for processes you want to protect or prioritize for killing:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo -1000 > /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj  # Less likely to be killed
Use Swap Space (Cautiously)

Add or increase swap:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
Be careful: swap is much slower than RAM.

Optimize the Application

Profile and optimize memory usage within your application.

Use efficient data structures, avoid large object retention, close resources.

Use cgroups (Linux) to isolate resources

Prevent one process from using all memory:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemd-run --scope -p MemoryMax=500M ./your_script.sh
‚úÖ Summary Checklist
Task	Command
Check if OOM Killer was triggered	`dmesg
Monitor memory usage	htop, vmstat, free -h
Find memory hogs	smem, ps aux --sort=-%mem
Set process memory priority	echo -1000 > /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj
Add swap (if needed)	sudo swapon /swapfile
Profile app memory use	Use language-specific tools (e.g., valgrind, memory_profiler)
